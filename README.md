# contrail-climate-metrics
This project surrounds the decision by airlines whether or not to avoid creating a contrail due to climate impact tradeoffs.

The Contrail Avoidance Decision Matrix is described in Chapter 4 of:
"Understanding Contrail Management: Opportunities, Challenges, and Insights A Comprehensive Overview Report": https://rmi.org/insight/understanding-contrail-management-opportunities-challenges-and-insights

The associated preprint, "Climate equivalence metrics for airline contrail mitigation" ,  is found here: https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/7378/
